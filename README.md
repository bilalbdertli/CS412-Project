## Overview of the Repository:
This repository contains the code and resources for the Machine Learning course project. The project involves both **classification** and **regression** tasks, with work conducted across three rounds. Each round has a dedicated folder with the following structure:


### Round I/II/III folders:
classification_roundX.ipynb: Notebook for the classification task.

regression_roundX.ipynb: Notebook for the regression task.

### Project Report:
Additionally, a comprehensive project report is included in PDF format, summarizing our approach, results, and analysis.

### Methodology:
We tackled the project in three iterative rounds to improve our models and strategies:

Round I: Initial baseline models and exploratory data analysis.
Round II: Improved feature engineering and tuning of hyperparameters.
Round III: Advanced techniques, including ensemble learning and final optimizations.

### Key considerations:

- Addressing class imbalance in classification tasks.
- Managing heavy-tailed distributions in regression tasks.
- Ensuring data consistency and handling missing values.
- Incorporating logarithmic transformations for regression to mitigate skewness.

### Results
The results for classification are evaluated using **accuracy**, while regression tasks are assessed with **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** on **log-transformed** data. Key findings:

Classification: Improved accuracy over iterations, achieving [insert final accuracy here].
Regression: Significant reduction in MSE, achieving [insert final MSE here].
Detailed results, including figures and tables, can be found in the project report (PDF).
